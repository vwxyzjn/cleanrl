# CleanRL v1 Release


ðŸŽ‰ We are thrilled to announce the v1.0.0 CleanRL Release. Along with our [CleanRL paper's recent publication in Journal of Machine Learning Research](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v23/21-1342.html), our v1.0.0 release includes reworked documentation, new algorithm variants, support for google's new ML framework [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax), hyperparameter tuning utilities, and more. CleanRL has come a long way making high-quality deep reinforcement learning implementations easy to understand and reproducible. This release is a major milestone for the project and we are excited to share it with you. Over 90 PRs were merged to make this release possible. We would like to thank all the contributors who made this release possible.

More detailed release notes are available at [v1.0.0b1](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/releases/tag/v1.0.0b1), [v1.0.0b2](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/releases/tag/v1.0.0b2), and [v1.0.0](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/releases/tag/v1.0.0).

## Reworked documentation

One of the biggest change of the v1 release is the added documentation at [docs.cleanrl.dev](https://docs.cleanrl.dev). Having great documentation is important for building a reliable and reproducible project. We have reworked the documentation to make it easier to understand and use. For each implemented algorithm, we have documented as much as we can to promote transparency:

* [Short description of the algorithm and references](/rl-algorithms/ppo/#overview)
* [A list of implemented variant](/rl-algorithms/ppo/#implemented-variants)
* [The usage information](/rl-algorithms/ppo/#usage)
* [The explanation of the logged metrics](/rl-algorithms/ppo/#explanation-of-the-logged-metrics)
* [The documentation of implementation details](/rl-algorithms/ppo/#implementation-details)
* [Experimental results](/rl-algorithms/ppo/#experiment-results)

Here is a list of the algorithm variants and their documentation:

We also improved the [contribution guide](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to make it easier for new contributors to get started. We are still working on improving the documentation. If you have any suggestions, please let us know in the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/issues).


## New algorithm variants, support for JAX

We now support JAX-based learning algorithm variants, which are usually faster than the `torch` equivalent! Here are the docs of the new JAX-based DQN, TD3, and DDPG implementations:


* [`dqn_atari_jax.py`](https://docs.cleanrl.dev/rl-algorithms/dqn/#dqn_atari_jaxpy) [@kinalmehta](https://github.com/kinalmehta) in [:material-github: vwxyzjn/cleanrl#222](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/pull/222)
    * about 25% faster than `dqn_atari.py`.
* [`td3_continuous_action_jax.py`](https://docs.cleanrl.dev/rl-algorithms/td3/#td3_continuous_action_jaxpy) by [@joaogui1](https://github.com/joaogui1) in [:material-github: vwxyzjn/cleanrl#225](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/pull/225)
    * about 2.5-4x faster than `td3_continuous_action.py`.
* [`ddpg_continuous_action_jax.py`](https://docs.cleanrl.dev/rl-algorithms/ddpg/#ddpg_continuous_action_jaxpy) by [@vwxyzjn](https://github.com/vwxyzjn) in [:material-github: vwxyzjn/cleanrl#187](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/pull/187)
    * about 2.5-4x faster than `ddpg_continuous_action.py`.
* [`ppo_atari_envpool_xla_jax.py`](https://docs.cleanrl.dev/rl-algorithms/ppo/#ppo_atari_envpool_xla_jaxpy) by [@vwxyzjn](https://github.com/vwxyzjn) in [:material-github: vwxyzjn/cleanrl#227](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/pull/227)
    * about 3x faster than openai/baselines' PPO.

For example, below are the benchmark of DDPG + JAX (see docs [here](/rl-algorithms/ddpg/#ddpg_continuous_action_jaxpy) for further detail):


<div class="grid-container">
<img src="/rl-algorithms/ddpg-jax/HalfCheetah-v2.png">
<img src="/rl-algorithms/ddpg-jax/HalfCheetah-v2-time.png">
</div>

Other new algorithm variants include multi-GPU PPO, PPO prototype that works with [Isaac Gym](https://github.com/NVIDIA-Omniverse/IsaacGymEnvs), multi-agent Atari PPO, and refactored PPG and PPO-RND implementations:

* [`ppo_atari_multigpu.pu`](https://docs.cleanrl.dev/rl-algorithms/ppo/#ppo_atari_multigpupy) by [@vwxyzjn](https://github.com/vwxyzjn) in [:material-github: vwxyzjn/cleanrl#178]( https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/pull/178)
    * about 34% faster than `ppo_atari.py` which uses `SyncVectorEnv`.
* [`ppo_continuous_action_isaacgym.py`](https://docs.cleanrl.dev/rl-algorithms/ppo/#ppo_continuous_action_isaacgympy) by [@vwxyzjn](https://github.com/vwxyzjn) in [:material-github: vwxyzjn/cleanrl#233](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/pull/233)
    * achieves 4000+ score and 30M steps on IsaacGymEnvs' `Ant` in 4 mins. 
* [`ppo_pettingzoo_ma_atari.py`](https://docs.cleanrl.dev/rl-algorithms/ppo/#ppo_pettingzoo_ma_ataripy) by [@vwxyzjn](https://github.com/vwxyzjn) in [:material-github: vwxyzjn/cleanrl#188](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/pull/188)
    * achieves ~4000 *episodic length* (not episodic return) in Pong, creating competitive self play agents.
* [`ppg_procgen.py`](https://docs.cleanrl.dev/rl-algorithms/ppg/#ppg_procgenpy) by [@Dipamc77](https://github.com/Dipamc77) in [:material-github: vwxyzjn/cleanrl#186](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/pull/186)
    * matches openai/baselines' PPO performance in StarPilot (easy), BossFight (easy), and BigFish (easy).
* [`ppo_rnd_envpoolpy.py`](https://docs.cleanrl.dev/rl-algorithms/ppo-rnd/#ppo_rnd_envpoolpy) by [@yooceii](https://github.com/yooceii) in [:material-github: vwxyzjn/cleanrl#151](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/pull/151)
    * achieves ~7100 in `MontezumaRevengeNoFrameSkip-v4`.



## Tooling improvements

We love tools! The v1.0.0 release comes with a series of DevOps improvements, including pre-commit utilities, CI integration with GitHub to run end-to-end test cases. We also make available a new hyperparameter tuning tool and a new tool for running benchmark experiments.

### DevOps

We added a pre-commit utility to help contributors to format their code, check for spelling, and removing unused variables and imports before submitting a pull request (see [Contribution guide](/contribution/#pre-commit-utilities) for more detail).

<img src="/static/pre-commit.png">


To ensure our single-file implementations can run without error, we also added CI/CD pipeline which now runs end-to-end test cases for all the algorithm variants. The pipeline also tests builds across different operating systems, such as Linux, macOS, and Windows (see [here](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/actions/runs/3401991711/usage) as an example). GitHub actions are free for open source projects, and we are very happy to have this tool to help us maintain the project. 

<img src="/static/blog/cleanrl-v1/github-action.png">

### Hyperparameter tuning utilities

We now have preliminary support for hyperparameter tuning via `optuna` (see [docs](https://docs.cleanrl.dev/advanced/hyperparameter-tuning/)), which is designed to help researchers to find **a single set** of hyperparameters that work well with a kind of games. The current API looks like below:

```python
import optuna
from cleanrl_utils.tuner import Tuner
tuner = Tuner(
    script="cleanrl/ppo.py",
    metric="charts/episodic_return",
    metric_last_n_average_window=50,
    direction="maximize",
    aggregation_type="average",
    target_scores={
        "CartPole-v1": [0, 500],
        "Acrobot-v1": [-500, 0],
    },
    params_fn=lambda trial: {
        "learning-rate": trial.suggest_loguniform("learning-rate", 0.0003, 0.003),
        "num-minibatches": trial.suggest_categorical("num-minibatches", [1, 2, 4]),
        "update-epochs": trial.suggest_categorical("update-epochs", [1, 2, 4, 8]),
        "num-steps": trial.suggest_categorical("num-steps", [5, 16, 32, 64, 128]),
        "vf-coef": trial.suggest_uniform("vf-coef", 0, 5),
        "max-grad-norm": trial.suggest_uniform("max-grad-norm", 0, 5),
        "total-timesteps": 100000,
        "num-envs": 16,
    },
    pruner=optuna.pruners.MedianPruner(n_startup_trials=5),
    sampler=optuna.samplers.TPESampler(),
)
tuner.tune(
    num_trials=100,
    num_seeds=3,
)
```

### Benchmarking utilities

We also added a new tool for running benchmark experiments. The tool is designed to help researchers to quickly run benchmark experiments across different algorithms environments with some random seeds. The tool lives in the `cleanrl_utils.benchmark` module, and the users can run commands such as:

```bash
OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 xvfb-run -a python -m cleanrl_utils.benchmark \
    --env-ids CartPole-v1 Acrobot-v1 MountainCar-v0 \
    --command "poetry run python cleanrl/ppo.py --cuda False --track --capture-video" \
    --num-seeds 3 \
    --workers 5
```

which will run the `ppo.py` script with `--cuda False --track --capture-video` arguments across 3 random seeds for 3 environments. It uses `multiprocessing` to create a pool of 5 workers run the experiments in parallel.




## Whatâ€™s next?

It is an exciting time and new improvements are coming to CleanRL. We plan to add more JAX-based implementations, huggingface integration, some RLops prototypes, and support Gymnasium. CleanRL is a community-based project and we always welcome new contributors. If there is an algorithm or new feature you would like to contribute, feel free to chat with us on our [discord channel](https://discord.gg/D6RCjA6sVT) or raise a GitHub issue. 

### More JAX implementations

More JAX-based implementation are coming. [Antonin Raffin](https://github.com/araffin), the core maintainer of [Stable-baselines3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3), [SBX](https://github.com/araffin/sbx), and [rl-baselines3-zoo](https://github.com/DLR-RM/rl-baselines3-zoo), is contributing an optimized Soft Actor Critic implementation in JAX ([:material-github: vwxyzjn/cleanrl#300](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/pull/300)) and TD3+TQC, and DroQ ([:material-github: vwxyzjn/cleanrl#272](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/pull/272). These are incredibly exciting new algorithms. For example, DroQ is extremely sample effcient and can obtain ~5000 return in `HalfCheetah-v3` in just 100k steps ([tracked sbx experiment](https://wandb.ai/openrlbenchmark/sbx/runs/1tyzq3tu)).

### Huggingface integration

[Huggingface Hub ðŸ¤—](https://huggingface.co/models) is a great platform for sharing and collaborating models. We are working on a new integration with Huggingface Hub to make it easier for researchers to share their RL models and benchmark them against other models ([:material-github: vwxyzjn/cleanrl#292](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/pull/292)). Stay tuned! In the future, we will have a simple snippet for loading models like below:

```python
import random
from typing import Callable

import gym
import numpy as np
import torch


def evaluate(
    model_path: str,
    make_env: Callable,
    env_id: str,
    eval_episodes: int,
    run_name: str,
    Model: torch.nn.Module,
    device: torch.device,
    epsilon: float = 0.05,
    capture_video: bool = True,
):
    envs = gym.vector.SyncVectorEnv([make_env(env_id, 0, 0, capture_video, run_name)])
    model = Model(envs).to(device)
    model.load_state_dict(torch.load(model_path))
    model.eval()

    obs = envs.reset()
    episodic_returns = []
    while len(episodic_returns) < eval_episodes:
        if random.random() < epsilon:
            actions = np.array([envs.single_action_space.sample() for _ in range(envs.num_envs)])
        else:
            q_values = model(torch.Tensor(obs).to(device))
            actions = torch.argmax(q_values, dim=1).cpu().numpy()
        next_obs, _, _, infos = envs.step(actions)
        for info in infos:
            if "episode" in info.keys():
                print(f"eval_episode={len(episodic_returns)}, episodic_return={info['episode']['r']}")
                episodic_returns += [info["episode"]["r"]]
        obs = next_obs

    return episodic_returns


if __name__ == "__main__":
    from huggingface_hub import hf_hub_download

    from cleanrl.dqn import QNetwork, make_env

    model_path = hf_hub_download(repo_id="cleanrl/CartPole-v1-dqn-seed1", filename="q_network.pth")
```

### RLops

How do we know the effect of a new feature / bug fix? DRL is brittle and has a series of reproducibility issues â€” even bug fixes sometimes could introduce performance regression (e.g., see [how a bug fix of contact force in MuJoCo results in worse performance for PPO](https://github.com/openai/gym/pull/2762#discussion_r853488897)). Therefore, it is essential to understand how the proposed changes impact the performance of the algorithms. 

We are working a prototype tool that allows us to compare the performance of the library at different versions of the tracked experiment ([:material-github: vwxyzjn/cleanrl#307](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/pull/307)). With this tool, we can confidently merge new features / bug fixes without worrying about introducing catastrophic regression. The users can run commands such as:

```bash
python -m cleanrl_utils.rlops --exp-name ddpg_continuous_action \
    --wandb-project-name cleanrl \
    --wandb-entity openrlbenchmark \
    --tags 'pr-299' 'rlops-pilot' \
    --env-ids HalfCheetah-v2 Walker2d-v2 Hopper-v2 InvertedPendulum-v2 Humanoid-v2 Pusher-v2 \
    --output-filename compare.png \
    --scan-history \
    --metric-last-n-average-window 100 \
    --report
```

which generates the following image

### Support for Gymnasium

[Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium) is the next generation of [`openai/gym`](https://github.com/openai/gym) that will continue to be maintained and introduce new features. Please see their [announcement](https://farama.org/Announcing-The-Farama-Foundation) for further detail. We are migrating to `gymnasium` and the progress can be tracked in [:material-github: vwxyzjn/cleanrl#277](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/pull/277).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Today we&#39;re launching the Farama Foundation, a new nonprofit dedicated to open source reinforcement learning, and we&#39;re beginning by maintaining and standardizing all the major open source reinforcement learning environments.

Also, the Farama foundation is working a project called [Shimmy](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Shimmy) which offers conversion wrapper for [`deepmind/dm_env`](https://github.com/deepmind/dm_env) environments, such as [`dm_control`](https://github.com/deepmind/dm_control) and [`deepmind/lab`](https://github.com/deepmind/lab). This is an exciting project that will allow us to support `deepmind/dm_env` in the future.
