# Categorical DQN (C51)

## Overview

C51 introduces a distributional perspective for DQN: instead of learning a single value for an action, C51 learns to predict a distribution of values for the action. Empirically, C51 demonstrates impressive performance in ALE.

Below are our single-file implementations of C51:


## `c51_atari.py`

The [c51_atari.py](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/blob/master/cleanrl/c51_atari.py) has the following features:

* For playing Atari games. It uses convolutional layers and common atari-based pre-processing techniques.
* Works with the Atari's pixel `Box` observation space of shape `(210, 160, 3)`
* Works with the `Discrete` action space

### Usage

```bash
poetry install --with atari
python cleanrl/c51_atari.py --env-id BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4
python cleanrl/c51_atari.py --env-id PongNoFrameskip-v4
```


### Explanation of the logged metrics

Running `python cleanrl/c51_atari.py` will automatically record various metrics such as actor or value losses in Tensorboard. Below is the documentation for these metrics:

* `charts/episodic_return`: episodic return of the game
* `charts/SPS`: number of steps per second
* `losses/loss`: the cross entropy loss between the $t$ step state value distribution and the projected $t+1$ step state value distribution
* `losses/q_values`: implemented as `(old_pmfs * q_network.atoms).sum(1)`, which is the sum of the probability of getting returns $x$ (`old_pmfs`) multiplied by $x$ (`q_network.atoms`), averaged over the sample obtained from the replay buffer; useful when gauging if under or over estimation happens


### Implementation details

[c51_atari.py](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/blob/master/cleanrl/c51_atari.py) is based on (Bellemare et al., 2017)[^1] but presents a few implementation differences:

1. (Bellemare et al., 2017)[^1] injects stochaticity by doing "on each frame the environment rejects the agent’s selected action with probability $p = 0.25$", but `c51_atari.py` does not do this
1. `c51_atari.py` use a self-contained evaluation scheme: `c51_atari.py` reports the episodic returns obtained throughout training, whereas (Bellemare et al., 2017)[^1] is trained with `--end-e=0.01` but reported episodic returns using a separate evaluation process with `--end-e=0.001` (See "5.2. State-of-the-Art Results" on page 7).


### Experiment results

To run benchmark experiments, see :material-github: [benchmark/c51.sh](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/blob/master/benchmark/c51.sh). Specifically, execute the following command:

<script src="https://emgithub.com/embed.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvwxyzjn%2Fcleanrl%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fbenchmark%2Fc51.sh%23L8-L13&style=github&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showCopy=on"></script>

Below are the average episodic returns for `c51_atari.py`. 


| Environment      | `c51_atari.py` 10M steps | (Bellemare et al., 2017, Figure 14)[^1] 50M steps | (Hessel et al., 2017, Figure 5)[^3] 
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ---- |
| BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4      | 461.86 ± 69.65      | 748  | ~500 at 10M steps, ~600 at 50M steps
| PongNoFrameskip-v4  | 19.46 ± 0.70    |  20.9 |  ~20 10M steps, ~20 at 50M steps 
| BeamRiderNoFrameskip-v4   | 9592.90 ± 2270.15        | 14,074 | ~12000 10M steps, ~14000 at 50M steps 


Note that we save computational time by reducing timesteps from 50M to 10M, but our `c51_atari.py` scores the same or higher than (Mnih et al., 2015)[^1] in 10M steps.

## `c51.py`

The [c51.py](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/blob/master/cleanrl/c51.py) has the following features:

* Works with the `Box` observation space of low-level features
* Works with the `Discrete` action space
* Works with envs like `CartPole-v1`


### Usage

```bash
python cleanrl/c51.py --env-id CartPole-v1
```


### Explanation of the logged metrics

See [related docs](/rl-algorithms/c51/#explanation-of-the-logged-metrics) for `c51_atari.py`.

### Implementation details

The [c51.py](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/blob/master/cleanrl/c51.py) shares the same implementation details as [`c51_atari.py`](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/blob/master/cleanrl/c51_atari.py) except the `c51.py` runs with different hyperparameters and neural network architecture. Specifically,

1. `c51.py` uses a simpler neural network as follows:
        ```python
        self.network = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(np.array(env.single_observation_space.shape).prod(), 120),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(120, 84),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(84, env.single_action_space.n),
        )
        ```
2. `c51.py` runs with different hyperparameters:

    ```bash
    python c51.py --total-timesteps 500000 \
        --learning-rate 2.5e-4 \
        --buffer-size 10000 \
        --gamma 0.99 \
        --target-network-frequency 500 \
        --max-grad-norm 0.5 \
        --batch-size 128 \
        --start-e 1 \
        --end-e 0.05 \
        --exploration-fraction 0.5 \
        --learning-starts 10000 \
        --train-frequency 10
    ```


### Experiment results

To run benchmark experiments, see :material-github: [benchmark/c51.sh](https://github.com/vwxyzjn/cleanrl/blob/master/benchmark/c51.sh). Specifically, execute the following command:

<script src="https://emgithub.com/embed.js?target=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvwxyzjn%2Fcleanrl%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fbenchmark%2Fc51.sh%23L2-L6&style=github&showBorder=on&showLineNumbers=on&showFileMeta=on&showCopy=on"></script>


Below are the average episodic returns for `c51.py`. 


| Environment      | `c51.py`  | 
| ----------- | ----------- | 
| CartPole-v1      | 481.20 ± 20.53      |
| Acrobot-v1  | -87.70 ± 5.52     | 
| MountainCar-v0   | -166.38 ± 27.94        | 


Note that the C51 has no official benchmark on classic control environments, so we did not include a comparison. That said, our `c51.py` was able to achieve near perfect scores in `CartPole-v1` and `Acrobot-v1`; further, it can obtain successful runs in the sparse environment `MountainCar-v0`.
