## Overview

CleanRL is a Deep Reinforcement Learning library that provides high-quality single-file implementation with research-friendly features. The implementation is clean and simple, yet we can scale it to run thousands of experiments using AWS Batch. The highlight features of CleanRL are:


* Single-file Implementation
    * **Every detail about an algorithm is put into the algorithm's own file.** Therefore, it's easier for you to fully understand an algorithm and do research with it.
* Benchmarked Implementation on 7+ algorithms and 34+ games 
* Tensorboard Logging
* Local Reproducibility via Seeding
* Videos of Gameplay Capturing
* Experiment Management with [Weights and Biases](https://wandb.ai/site)
* Cloud Integration with Docker and AWS 

You can read more about CleanRL in our [technical paper]((https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08819)) and [documentation](https://docs.cleanrl.dev/).

Good luck have fun ðŸš€
